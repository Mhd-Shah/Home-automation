# Home-automation 
In this circuit there is a normal switch that can be controlled through mobile application or browser.
When this switch is turned on, the bulb continuously light until we turn off the switch.
When this switch is turned off, the bulb will turn on if there is any motion in the room. 
The bulb will continue in  the turned on state until the motion stops. 
The motion in the room is detected using a PIR motion sensor and a relay module is used to control the current flow based on the instructions of the ESP 32 .
Also there is an external switch that helps to turn off the light completely.
It will help to turn off the light in case of necessary. 
See the ciciut diagram for more details.
