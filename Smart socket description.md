# Smart-Socket
This system is to automatically turn on the socket for a period of time.
We can provide the duration to which the socket has to continue in the on state. 
We can set the time interval between which the device connected to the socket has to work. 
We can also create a routine. 
This is done using the scheduler in arduino IoT.
A relay module is used to control the current flow through the socket.
See the circuit diagram and user interface for more details.
